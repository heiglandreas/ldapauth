Feature: Retrieve attributes from an LDAP Entry	Scenario: Retrieve 2 existing Attributes from a user entry		Given the ldap-entry "uid=foo,dc=users,dc=example,dc=com" exists		And contains the attribute "uid" with value "foo"		And contains the attribute "email" with value "foo@example.com"		When I retrieve the attributes "email, uid" for entry "uid=foo, dc=users, dc=example, dc=com"		Then I will get an array containing only "foo@example.com" as value for key "email"		And I will get an array containing only "foo" as value for key "uid"	Scenario: Retrieve 2 existing Attributes from one attribute of a user entry		Given the ldap-entry "uid=foo,dc=users,dc=example,dc=com" exists		And contains the attribute "email" with value "foobar@example.com"		And contains the attribute "email" with value "foo@example.com"		When I retrieve the attributes "email" for entry "uid=foo, dc=users, dc=example, dc=com"		Then I will get an array containing "foo@example.com" as value for key "email"		And I will get an array containing "foobar@example.com" as value for key "email"	Scenario: Retrieve 1 existing and one nonexisting Attributes from a user entry		Given the ldap-entry "uid=foo,dc=users,dc=example,dc=com" exists		And contains the attribute "uid" with value "foo"		When I retrieve the attributes "email,uid" for entry "uid=foo, dc=users, dc=example, dc=com"		Then I will get an array containing only "foo" as value for key "uid"		And I will get an empty array as value for key "email"	Scenario: Retrieve two nonexisting Attributes from a user entry		Given the ldap-entry "uid=foo,dc=users,dc=example,dc=com" exists		When I retrieve the attributes "email,uid" for entry "uid=foo, dc=users, dc=example, dc=com"		Then I will get an empty array as value for key "uid"		And I will get an empty array as value for key "email"  # With this setup one can without issue query for attributes that an entry doesn't support.  # Shall that be prohibited? That would mean that we'd need to query the schema for the objectTypes and  # allowed attributes.  # Adding that later will be a BC-break!
